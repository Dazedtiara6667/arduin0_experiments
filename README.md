List of experiments performed by me using arduino board
## First Experiment ##
A simple circuit in which two led blink within a gap of one second.

## Second Experiment ##
 A simple Norse Code for SOS message.
## Third Experiment ##
Using potentiometer to display voltage in serial monitor if voltage is high a red light glows.Voltage increases or decreases as we rotate the knob on potentiometer.At right side voltage is zero and as we rotate it voltage increases.Will explain more about potentiometer later.

## Fourth Experiment ##
By the help of Potentiometer which acts as a sensor when we rotate the knob on potentiometer the light glows brighter or dimmer according to the rotation of Potentiometer.In a way LED acts as an actuator and the potentiometer a sensor.
